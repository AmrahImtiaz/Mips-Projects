# MIPS Projects 
This repository is created to assist students in understanding and mastering MIPS assembly language. MIPS is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture widely taught in computer science courses. The projects and examples provided here are designed to illustrate key concepts and provide hands-on experience with MIPS programming.
